This project was an image recognition machine learning project that I created. The objective was to analyzing photos of an eclipse and determining the angle of the eclipse 
and the images in order to rotate them all to solar north so the images could be overlayed and the solar corona could be studied. The challenge was that this task had always been done manually 
and bringing a machine learning and automated intelligence dimension into the mix was very novel. In the end, the instructor was impressed with the creativity and output, and I took away a 
great deal of learning about how to break down complex problems, the need for iterating and continuous improvement and how to apply what we were leaning in class to real world challenges.
